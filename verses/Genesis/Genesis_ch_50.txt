Verse 1: 1Well at that, JoSeph fell over his father’s face, cried over him, and kissed him.
Verse 2: 2Then JoSeph told his servants (the embalmers) to [take charge of] his father’s body, and the embalmers mummified IsraEl.
Verse 3: 3The process took 40 days, because that’s how long it took to mummify someone. And all of Egypt mourned for him during the next 70 days.
Verse 4: 4Then when the days of mourning were completed, JoSeph spoke to the PharaOh’s mighty ones and said: ‘If I’ve found favor in your eyes, talk to PharaOh for me and tell him that
Verse 5: 5my father made me swear, saying: ‘I want you to bury me in the tomb that I dug for myself in the land of CanaAn.’ ‘So I wish to go there and bury my father… And then I’ll return.’
Verse 6: 6And PharaOh said to JoSeph: ‘Go up and bury your father, just as he made you swear.’
Verse 7: 7So JoSeph went up [to the land of CanaAn] to bury his father; and all of PharaOh’s servants and elders of his house, as well as all the elders of the land of Egypt traveled with him
Verse 8: 8and the households of JoSeph and his brothers, as well as the household of his father and his relatives. However, they left the sheep and oxen behind in the land of Gesem…
Verse 9: 9The entourage also included many chariots and horsemen, and a large crowd of others.
Verse 10: 10Then, upon arriving at the threshing-floor of Atad (which is across the JorDan), they wailed for [Jacob] with a very deep grief, and they mourned there for [JoSeph’s] father for the next 7 days.
Verse 11: 11Well, when the people of the land of CanaAn saw the mourning at the floor of Atad, they said: ‘This is a huge mourning to the Egyptians!’ So after that, they named the place The Mourning of Egypt Beyond the JorDan.
Verse 12: 12Yes, that’s what his sons did for him.
Verse 13: 13His sons carried him up into the land of CanaAn and buried him in the double cave that AbraHam bought as his own burying place from EphRon the Kettite, which is across from MamRe.
Verse 14: 14Then JoSeph and his brothers returned to Egypt, along with all those who had come with him to bury his father.
Verse 15: 15Well, after JoSeph’s brothers saw that their father had died, they said: ‘Let’s not forget that JoSeph can decide to get even with us and pay us back for all the evil things that we did to him at any time!’
Verse 16: 16So they went to JoSeph and said: ‘Before his death, your father made us swear. He instructed us
Verse 17: 17to tell JoSeph to forgive us for the bad things we’ve done and for our sins, because we’ve really done some evil things to you. ‘Therefore, please forgive the injustice of the servants of the God of your father.’ Well, JoSeph started to weep while they were talking to him.
Verse 18: 18Then they came up to him and said: ‘We are your servants!’
Verse 19: 19And JoSeph said: ‘Don’t be afraid, for I [belong to] God.
Verse 20: 20And even though you once met and talked about doing evil things to me, God made what you said about me [turn out] for the good. ‘And that’s why things happened as they have today… So that many people might be fed.’
Verse 21: 21Then he said to them: ‘Don’t be afraid... I’ll take care of you and your families.’ And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them.
Verse 22: 22Well, JoSeph continued to live in Egypt along with his brothers and his father’s family for 110 years.
Verse 23: 23JoSeph [lived to] see Ephraim’s children through to the third generation, and the sons of MachIr (ManasSeh’s son) were born at his side.
Verse 24: 24Then JoSeph told his [family]: ‘I’m dying. But, God will surely come to you and take you from this land into the land that God swore to give to our ancestors, AbraHam, IsaAc, and Jacob.’
Verse 25: 25Then JoSeph made the Sons of IsraEl swear, saying: ‘When God comes for you, you must carry my bones back with you.’
Verse 26: 26So JoSeph died at the age of 110 [c. 1879 BCE], and they prepared his body, then they placed it in a [tomb] in Egypt.
